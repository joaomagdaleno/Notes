Warning: A call to tap() with finder "Found 1 widget with key [<'favorites'>]: [
  ListTile-[<'favorites'>](onTap: Closure: () => void, dependencies: [Directionality, InheritedCupertinoTheme, ListTileTheme, _InheritedTheme, _LocalizationsScope-[GlobalKey#c33b2]]),
]" derived an Offset (Offset(-152.0, 253.0)) that would not hit test on the specified widget.
Maybe the widget is actually off-screen, or another widget is obscuring it, or the widget cannot receive pointer events.
Indeed, Offset(-152.0, 253.0) is outside the bounds of the root of the render tree, Size(800.0, 600.0).
The finder corresponds to this RenderBox: RenderSemanticsAnnotations#de9b5 relayoutBoundary=up1
The hit test result at that offset is: HitTestResult(HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#6d87c(_ReusableRenderView#b661a), HitTestEntry<HitTestTarget>#3636c(<AutomatedTestWidgetsFlutterBinding>))
